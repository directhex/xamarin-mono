binfmt-detector-cli

	This utility determines the Microsoft PE executable file's
	type (Native or .NET CLR).

	It is inteded to be used as a filter a Linux binfmt
	configuration, since binfmt itself is incapable of reliably
	distinguishing between various PE file types (since they have
	no different "magic string").

Technical information

	The file's type is determined from certain characteristics
	in the PE / COFF file header. It should be noted that the
	techniques used might not be standard and are not throughtly
	tested to work, so false detections might occur.

	To be considered a CLR executable, the PE header's directory
	entry for the "CLR Header" must have a non-zero address and
	a non-zero size.
